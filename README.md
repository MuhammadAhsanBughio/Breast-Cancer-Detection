### Project Overview ðŸ’¡
This project focuses on leveraging supervised learning models to develop an accurate breast cancer prediction system. By analyzing different features extracted from breast cancer patients, including known cases labeled as Malignant or Benign, the aim is to assess and compare various algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, SVM, and Naive Bayes. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall will guide the assessment process. The results of this study hold significant promise in advancing breast cancer diagnosis and improving medical decision-making, emphasizing the importance of early detection and precise diagnosis for enhanced treatment outcomes.
